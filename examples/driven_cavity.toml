# The naming/indexing convention used for boundaries is as follows:
# 
#      x_neg/west/left   = 0   (all dimensions)
#      x_pos/east/right  = 1   (all dimensions)
#      y_neg/south/front = 2   (2D/3D)
#      y_pos/north/back  = 3   (2D/3D)
#      z_neg/bottom/down = 4   (3D)
#      z_pos/top/up      = 5   (3D)
#
# Available boundary conditions are as follows:
#      free-slip      = 0
#      no-slip        = 1
#      inflow/outflow = 2
#      periodic       = 3
#
